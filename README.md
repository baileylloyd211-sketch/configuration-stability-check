# Configuration Stability Check (v1)

This project is a baseline instrument for assessing whether a system
(personal, organizational, operational, or abstract) is likely to remain
workable under continued conditions.

It is **not**:
- a diagnostic tool
- a personality assessment
- a predictor of outcomes
- an optimization or coaching system

It provides **orientation**, not answers.

## What This Tool Does

The Configuration Stability Check samples how strain appears and concentrates
when a system operates under sustained load.

Rather than asking direct evaluative questions, it uses:
- system-level language
- rotated question grammars
- non-ordinal answer sets
- adaptive sampling logic (in later versions)

The goal is to establish a **baseline probability** that continuing unchanged
will increase instability — without moralizing, diagnosing, or prescribing action.

## Intended Use (v1)

This version is designed for:
- independent operators
- founders
- small teams
- individuals facing a decision inflection

Typical questions this tool helps contextualize:
- “Is this just hard, or structurally unsustainable?”
- “If nothing changes, what is this likely to become?”
- “Where is strain actually concentrating?”

## What v1 Includes

- Streamlit-based web interface
- Start condition (system type + condition persistence)
- Adaptive question loop (static in v1)
- Snapshot summary
- Downloadable JSON profile for cumulative review

---

## What v1 Does NOT Include (By Design)

- No AI-generated questions
- No live adaptation to changing conditions
- No scoring visible to the user
- No advice, coaching, or recommendations
- No user accounts or stored personal data

Those features are explicitly out of scope for v1.
